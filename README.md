# ProceduralWorlds

Procedural Worlds is a dynamic link library that can be used to generate different types of worlds in any project that uses C++ or C#.

All world types that can currently be made:
- Infinite worlds
- Circular-shaped worlds
- Square-shaped worlds

A preset has been added to the library to generate a heightmap, but you can create a custom one as well.

As an example of what this library can do:  
You can use this noise, generated by only a few lines of code ([see below](#ExampleCode)) using this library, to generate an island like this in mere minutes!

## Example code: <a name="ExampleCode"></a>

### C++

```cpp
// Create a new generator
that::Generator gen{};

// Use the default preset to set up the heightmap
that::preset::Presets::CreateDefaultTerrain(gen, seed, mapZoom);

// Set up the size and shape of the generator
gen.SetSize(mapSize);
gen.SetShape(std::make_unique<that::shape::SquarePeak>(angularity, smoothPower));
```

### C#

```cs
// Create a new generator
that.Generator gen = new that.Generator();

// Use the default preset to set up the heightmap
that.preset.Presets.CreateDefaultTerrain(gen, _seed, _zoom);

// Set up the size and shape of the generator
gen.SetSize(_size);
gen.SetShape(new that.shape.SquarePeak(_angularity, _smoothPower);
```

### Full examples
Full fledged examples can be found in the [SDLWorld project](https://github.com/AtlantiaKing/ProceduralWorlds/tree/main/src/SDLWorld) (C++) and in the [examples folder](https://github.com/AtlantiaKing/ProceduralWorlds/tree/main/examples/unity) (Unity C#)

## Installation
Download the latest version of the C# or C++ library [here](https://github.com/AtlantiaKing/ProceduralWorlds/releases/).

### C++
The C++ zip file contains 
- an include folder with all the headers necessary to use the library.
- a lib folder that contains the x64 and x86 .lib and .dll files necessary to use the library.

### C#
The C# zip file contains  
- a lib folder that contains the x64 and x86 .dll file necessary to use the library.  
- a src folder that contains all the C# equivalent code that hooks into the library ready to use.  

## Usage
Check out the documentation [here](https://atlantiaking.github.io/ProceduralWorlds/).

## Github project structure
   
This project contains two source directories:
- **src**  
    This is the C++ source of the project.  
    This solution contains of two projects:  
    - **ProceduralWorlds library**  
    A dynamic link library that can be used to generate different kinds of worlds.  
    The dll is usable in both C++ and in C#.
    - **SDLWorld**  
    A test project that uses SDL to draw a world generated by the ProceduralWorlds library.

- **csharpsrc**  
   This is the C# wrapper around the ProceduralWorlds dll
