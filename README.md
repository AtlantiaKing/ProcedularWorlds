# ProcedularWorlds
## Introduction
 A project that explores different kinds of procedular world generation.

 This solution contains of two projects:
 - **ProcedularWorlds library**  
    A dynamic link library that can be used to generate different kinds of worlds.  
    The dll is usable in both C++ and in C#. (C# wrapper will be added in the future)
 - **SDLWorld**  
    A test project that uses SDL to draw a world generated by the ProcedularWorlds library.

## ProcedularWorlds usage
The main class in this library is called "Generator".  
This is a class that manages all the other generators such as heightmaps, river generators, villages generators, etc.  
The user can mix and match different generators (pre-made or custom made) by assigning them to the main generator.  
  
All data can be read from the main Generator such as the height, river state, village state, etc. per coordinate.
