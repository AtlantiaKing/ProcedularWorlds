## Introduction
   
This project contains two source directories:
- **src**  
    This is the C++ source of the project.  
    This solution contains of two projects:  
    - **ProcedularWorlds library**  
    A dynamic link library that can be used to generate different kinds of worlds.  
    The dll is usable in both C++ and in C#.
    - **SDLWorld**  
    A test project that uses SDL to draw a world generated by the ProcedularWorlds library.

- **csharpsrc**  
   This is the C# wrapper around the ProcedularWorlds dll

## Installation

The C++ zip file contains 
- an include folder with all the headers necessary to use the library.
- a lib folder that contains the x64 and x86 .lib and .dll files necessary to use the library.

### C#
The C# zip file contains  
- a lib folder that contains the x64 and x86 .dll file necessary to use the library.
